This was a pretty quick project! I covered my wind controller in WS2812 RGB LEDs and wired them all to a microcontroller and a little DC/DC power supply. I fed it 20V over USB-C, and it stepped it down to 5V and the very high current needed. The lineout of the wind controller went to a [Pixelblaze Sensor Expansion Board](https://shop.electromage.com/products/pixelblaze-sensor-expansion-board?srsltid=AfmBOorHh2tweQ16XxGlIHuoSNQGD2IDDGLe0hQOGYSj1ciZGr6mCeKW) which did the FFT, and an ESP32 turned that data into a light-show on the very instrument being played! Red->Yellow denotes pitch, while brightness indicates amplitude. It's a not perfect system, harmonic analysis vs frequency analysis are not identical, but it's still a pretty sight! You can see the system in action in the video below.
