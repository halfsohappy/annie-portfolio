<h3> Project Summary </h3>

This is version 5 of the Custom PCBs for my wireless synchronized LED accessory set. Though in fairness, this is actually the ninth PCB iteration manufactured for this project.

<h3> Motivation </h3>

Between v1 and v5 were many iterations that didn't see a full-batch production (i.e. were assembled many times into a full set of operational bands), whether that was due to the PCBs simply not operating correctly or not meeting my personal standards. Along the way, I made many decisions on what the next full set would look like. This post focuses mostly on the PCB design, however.

The immediately preceding version was v4.1 (shown above), which was operational and worked well! One feature I'm really proud of is the extremely sophisticated power path with switch that will completely disconnect the battery from all loads when in the off position, while still allowing the battery to be charged. When in the on position, plugging the device in puts all of the load on the power in *and* charges the battery, and will switch back to battery uninterupted when unplugged. But, the design had a few flaws that I felt needed to be improved before the huge time sink that is assembling a whole set of bands.

* The battery connected by a pair of 2mm pitch through holes, which lead to the soldered connection constantly breaking without strain relief (which I didn't have the space to provide)
* Soldering the battery to THTs also meant they were not easily swappable
* A design refresh which placed the PCB next to the battery, instead of on top, meant that the design benefited from a smaller form factor

With v5, I lost many comforts of v4.1 -- such as mounting holes and a hefty/satisfying slide switch. The design was also too fine to be assembled by me, since I switched from 0603 passives to 0402 passives, so I had to order them assembled. v5 had a more delicate switch that was at a worse angle, and a higher price tag, but the design shrunk from .95 inches wide to a mere .6 inches wide! Additionally, a battery connector meant that the battery was securely attached, and also easy to switch.

<h3> Design </h3>
Put simply, this design was the same as v4.1 but with all components swapped for the smallest componenet of the same type that was still in spec. The LDO went from a classic AMS1117 (SOT-223 package) to the more foreign "NCP706AMX" LDO, which somehow manages >1A of current in a package measuring 1.2 x 1.6mm! Everything that could be 0402 became 0402, and the ESP32C3 module went from the standard WROOM module to the more compact (and more expensive) WROOM-MINI package. The routing was basically "move parts until the nets seem possible, route until you give up, decide to reduce design constraints, repeat" until I got it working.

<h3> Aesthetics </h3>
These are black! Because they are visible on the outside of the bands. The back silkscreen says "She's a runner, She's a Pratt Star", which I put on every one of my PCBs, referencing a Duke joke about the Pratt School Of Engineering.

	Alright, yea. I got it pretty small.
