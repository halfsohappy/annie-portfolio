<h3> Project Summary </h3>

This is the first version of my wireless LED accessory set. It features seven leather bands, each with 28 WS2812 RGB LEDs, an ESP32C3 XIAO board, and a 300mAh battery. The bands are all synchronized (technically) to a main remote which can select different patterns for the set as a whole to display. The effect is completely mesmerizing (especially in person) and prompted many, many future iterations on this idea.

In terms of parts, these bands are the least complicated of all future iterations -- just leather, snaps, led strip, battery, and off-the-shelf microcontroller. In terms of construction, however, they were a huge headache.

<h3> Motivation </h3>



Between v1 and v5 were many iterations that didn't see a full-batch production (i.e. were assembled many times into a full set of operational bands), whether that was due to the PCBs simply not operating correctly or not meeting my personal standards. Along the way, I made many decisions on what the next full set would look like. This post focuses mostly on the PCB design.

The immediately preceding version was v4.1 (shown above), which was operational and worked well! One feature I'm really proud of is the extremely sophisticated power path with switch that will completely disconnect the battery from all loads when in the off position, while still allowing the battery to be charged. When in the on position, plugging the device in puts all of the load on the power in *and* charges the battery, and will switch back to battery uninterupted when unplugged. While the power path worked great, the design had a few flaws that I felt needed to be improved before the huge time sink that is assembling a whole set of bands.

* The battery connected by a pair of 2mm pitch through holes, which lead to the soldered connection constantly breaking without strain relief (which I didn't have the space to provide)
* Soldering the battery to THTs also meant they were not easily swappable
* I had just made a design refresh of the band which placed the PCB next to the battery instead of on top, meaning the design would now benefit from a smaller form factor

With v5, I lost many comforts of v4.1 -- such as mounting holes and a hefty/satisfying slide switch. Also, I couldn't assemble the boards myself since I switched from 0603 passives to 0402 passives -- so I had to order them assembled. v5 had a more delicate switch that was at a worse angle, and a higher price tag, but the design shrunk from .95 inches wide to a mere .6 inches wide! Additionally, a battery connector meant that the battery was securely attached, and also easy to swap out.

<h3> Design </h3>

The body of the band is a single piece of ~3mm veg-tanned leather that has been lazer cut to make clean LED cut-outs. The microcontroller has had the battery soldered on and both are stored in a small 3D-printed shell that is held onto the leather with screws. The LED strips are attached to the band with quick-hold E6000. The band is secured onto my arms with snaps, and each band is one of three sizes, depending on where it sits on the arm.

Each band uses 3 LED strips which were painstakingly wired to each other and to the microcontroller. Three tiny wires times three connections times seven bands equals 63 tiny wires

<h3> Aesthetics </h3>
These are black! Because they are visible on the outside of the bands. The back silkscreen says "She's a runner, She's a Pratt Star", which I put on every one of my PCBs, referencing a Duke joke about the Pratt School Of Engineering.

	Alright, yea. I got it pretty small.
