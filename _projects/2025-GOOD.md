This website uses the [jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a *heavily* modified [Board](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/board-portfolio-jekyll-theme) theme with the addition of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for all sorts of utilities and components. It's hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and you can find the full source on my Github [here](https://github.com/halfsohappy/annie-portfolio). To anyone who likes it, feel free to fork it and use it however you please!

I made this website because I didn't want to use a website builder for my portfolio -- my thinking being "then how will employers know that I can use a computer???" -- but this project, as most are, was a much larger undertaking than I anticipated. In developing annabel-lee.xyz, I've learned so much about web languages (HTML and (S)CSS), tools (Liquid and Bootstrap), and aesthetics.

My initial goals with this website were to:

* Communicate the vast number and scope of my past projects
* Create a totally unique (and undeniably custom) look
* Strike a balance between personality and professionalism
* Step out of my comfort zone with a project that uses no hardware

Ultimately, I'm proud of the final product and I think I accomplished these goals. I think the grid homepage does a great job at catching the eye and showing off just how *much* stuff I've made. I think the pink, white, and gray accents are striking but not immature, as is the "Annabel Lee" header font. And personally, I really love the look of my portfolio -- and I take pride in the hours on hours it took me to learn these new skills to deliver the final product. If I were to do this again though, I would do as many actual project write-ups as possible at first while hosting the website under a generic jekyll theme, so I could apply to internships quickly upfront and then do all of my beautification afterwards.

I hope you enjoy perusing the site!
